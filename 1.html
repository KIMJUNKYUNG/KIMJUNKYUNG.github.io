    HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content <br>
    by implementing a markup based pattern to it. HTML5 is the fifth and current major version of HTML,<br>
    and subsumes XHTML. The current standard, the HTML Living Standard is developed by WHATWG, which is<br>
    made up of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), with the Living Standard <br>
    also existing in an abridged version.
